useState is a Hook (function) that allows us to have state variables in functional components.

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
```

useState returns an array with 2 values: the current state and a function to update it.

**Example**

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react'
function Example() {
	// Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
	return (
		<div>
			<p>You clicked {count} times</p>
			<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
		</div>
	)
}
```
