title: Does useLayoutEffect run before render?
source: https://reactjs.org/

The useLayoutEffect hook works synchronously. It runs immediately after React has performed all DOM mutations. It will run after every render but before the screen is updated.

```js
const App = () => {
	const [val, setVal] = useState(0)
	const [val2, setVal2] = useState(0)

	useLayoutEffect(() => {
		console.log('useLayoutEffect')
	})

	return (
		<div>
			<input
				type='number'
				value={val}
				onChange={(e) => setVal(parseInt(e.target.value))}
			/>
			<input
				type='number'
				value={val2}
				onChange={(e) => setVal2(parseInt(e.target.value))}
			/>
		</div>
	)
}
```
