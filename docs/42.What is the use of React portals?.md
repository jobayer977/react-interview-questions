title: What is the use of React portals?
source: https://reactjs.org/

Portals provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. The first argument ( child ) is any renderable React child, such as an element, string, or fragment. The second argument ( container ) is a DOM element.

**Example**

```jsx
const App = () => {
	return ReactDOM.createPortal(
		<h1>Portals Demo</h1>,
		document.querySelector('body')
	)
}
```
