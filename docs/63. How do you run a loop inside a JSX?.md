Using the Array map function is a very common way to loop through an Array of elements and create components according to them in React. This is a great way to do a loop which is a pretty efficient and is a tidy way to do your loops in JSX.

Here is an example of how you would do a loop in JSX:

```jsx
const App = () => {
	const names = ['John', 'Paul', 'George', 'Ringo']
	return (
		<div>
			{names.map((name) => (
				<div>{name}</div>
			))}
		</div>
	)
}
```
