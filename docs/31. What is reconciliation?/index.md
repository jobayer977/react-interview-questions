Reconciliation is the process of comparing two sets of data and determining which items need to be added, removed, or updated to match the new data. This process is known as a diff, and it is often used to determine which DOM nodes need to be updated to reflect the new data. In React, reconciliation is performed automatically by React when the component is re-rendered. This is called reconciliation. The process of reconciling is known as a diff.
