**Stateless components**

Stateless components are components that do not have state. They are also called functional components. They are just functions that take props as an argument and return a React element. They are also called pure components because they do not have any side effects.

```js
const StatelessComponent = (props) => {
	return <div>{props.name}</div>
}
```

**Stateful components**

Stateful components are components that have state. They are also called class components. They are classes that extend React.Component and have a render method. They are also called impure components because they have side effects. But In React Hooks, we can also use state in functional components.

```js
class StatefulComponent extends React.Component {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props)
		this.state = {
			name: 'John',
		}
	}
	render() {
		return <div>{this.state.name}</div>
	}
}
```

**Hooks in functional components**

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react'

function FunctionalComponent() {
	const [name, setName] = useState('John')
	return <div>{name}</div>
}
```
