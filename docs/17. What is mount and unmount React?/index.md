title: What is mount and unmount React?

The main job of React is to figure out what to render to the screen. React will do this by comparing the current state of the application to the previous state. React does so by `mounting` and `unmounting` components. When a component is mounted, React will render it to the DOM. When a component is unmounted, React will remove it from the DOM.
