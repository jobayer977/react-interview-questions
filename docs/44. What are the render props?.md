title: What are the render props?

The term “render prop” refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function. A component with a render prop takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic.

**Example**

```jsx
const Mouse = (props) => {
	const [mouse, setMouse] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 })

	const handleMouseMove = (event) => {
		setMouse({
			x: event.clientX,
			y: event.clientY,
		})
	}

	return (
		<div style={{ height: '100%' }} onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}>
			{props.render(mouse)}
		</div>
	)
}

const App = () => {
	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Move the mouse around!</h1>
			<Mouse
				render={(mouse) => (
					<p>
						The current mouse position is ({mouse.x}, {mouse.y})
					</p>
				)}
			/>
		</div>
	)
}
```
